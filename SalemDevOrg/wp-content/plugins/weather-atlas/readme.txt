Weather Atlas Widget is:
- highly customizable (all design elements can be modified, data can be presented in various forms, languages and units),
- weather location manageable (users can select their preferred weather location)
- responsive (automatically adapt appearance for mobile displays),
- smart (background and borders adapt to current temperature, widget's font size automatically adjusts accordingly to web site's font size and the placement on a page),
- beautiful (even weather condition's icons are beautiful, simple and adapt size, color and shades of widget’s text) and
- simple (all options are easily changeable and, above all, weather information is presented in a clear and concise way)

= Features =
* Responsive web design adapts to mobile displays
* Easily styles to suit your theme
* Weather icons
* Current conditions, hourly and long-term forecast
* Detailed forecast
* Users' ability to set preferred weather location
* Placement in content or sidebar
* Any location worldwide
* Multi languages and units
* Multiple widgets option
* Easy setup

= Responsive web design adapts to mobile displays =
If the widget is in a horizontal layout (eg. placed in an article), for users who visit your page on a mobile device, the widget will reformat to vertical layout.
Details of current condition (feels like temperature, wind, humidity, pressure, UV index) and more than 3 hours/days of the forecast are hidden on mobile devices.
These accommodations are made in order to unclutter appearance and preserve beautiful design on narrow displays.

= Easily styles to suit your theme =
Besides choosing between two predefined layouts (vertical and horizontal), there are multiple options you can set in order to adjust widget to your website.
Font size - widget's font size, that automatically adjusts accordingly to web site's font size and the placement on a page, can be overwritten (in px, pt, em, rem, % etc.).
Background Color - background and borders adapt to current temperature, but the background can also be set to fixed color, even with transparency.
Text Color - is auto set as the best contrast to the automatic background color, but text color can also be overwritten.
Inline style - there is even an option in shortcode to set inline style of the widget (eg. float:right;width:200px).

= Weather icons =
Weather condition's icons are beautiful, simple and adapt size, color and shades of widget’s text.

= Current conditions, hourly and long-term forecast =
Choose weather information to display: from current conditions and hourly to long-term forecast.
Current conditions show current temperature, with a weather icon, feels like temperature, wind, humidity, pressure and UV index along with the sunrise/sunset time for the location.
Hourly forecast shows up to 5 hours of forecasted temperatures, with the weather icons.
The daily forecast shows up to 5 days of weather forecasts with high/low temperatures, with the weather condition icons.

= Detailed forecast =
Website users are pleased when you provide them the information they need in a clear and concise way (eg. by placing weather info on your pages).
By checking an option “detailed forecast” in settings, you’ll provide an option for visitors to open (in a new window) Weather Atlas’ full forecast for chosen location - and your website visitors will be grateful for that.

= Users' ability to set preferred weather location =
This option allows users to override preset weather location.
Weather location is changed by simply typing the name of the location into the search field and selecting favorite from the list of suggested locations.
[Why choosing a location from a drop-down is a better solution than geolocation?](../plugins/weather-atlas/#faq)

= Placement in content or sidebar =
Weather widget can be placed in a sidebar in a usual way (please read: [Installation](../plugins/weather-atlas/#installation) and [FAQ](../plugins/weather-atlas/#faq)).
And there is an option to place weather directly in articles, by using shortcode option (more on this option in [FAQ section](../plugins/weather-atlas/#faq)).

= Any location worldwide =
There are over 800.000 locations from 238 countries and territories. Guess you’ll find your location :)

= Multi Languages and units =
Currently supported languages are:
 - English
 - Spanish
 - Chinese
 - Russian
 - German
Temperature and other weather data are displayed in either Imperial (°F, in, mi) or Metric system (°C, mb, mm, km).

= Multiple widgets option =
Placing multiple widgets (either in a sidebar or in content) on the same page is not a problem.
Each weather widget has individual options and "lives independently" from others.

Widgets don't slow down a website, as they show cached weather data, stored in your database, and periodically update data from our service.

= Easy setup =
All options are easy to set, but if you still have questions or suggestions - please read [FAQ](../plugins/weather-atlas/#faq) and then drop us a line in the [support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/weather-atlas).

(for issues and other questions please check plugin's [support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/weather-atlas))

(for issues and other questions please check plugin's [support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/weather-atlas))

= How to place weather widget in the sidebar? =
Please read "After activation" in [Installation](../plugins/weather-atlas/#installation)

(for issues and other questions please check plugin's [support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/weather-atlas))

= How to place weather widget in the article? =
By placing "shortcode" in the article.

Shortcode can be basic: [shortcode-weather-atlas city_selector=2372139]
or with options: [shortcode-weather-atlas city_selector=2372139 language="es" layout="horizontal" background_color="#8224e3" style="float:right;width:200px" hourly=5 daily=0]

(omitted options load default option value)

In Admin panel "Appearance > Widgets", basic shortcode (with city_selector) is generated when choosing a location.
Below generated shortcode is a link "shortcode - all options" that shows all options for customizing weather widget.

(for issues and other questions please check plugin's [support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/weather-atlas))

= How to set custom style? =
Beside standard options (font size, background, text color...) there is additional option - style (available only in shortcode).
Just set desired inline style eg. style="float:right;width:200px" in shortcode and widget will adopt this style as well.

(for issues and other questions please check plugin's [support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/weather-atlas))

= Why choosing a location from a drop-down is a better solution than geolocation? =
At first glance having a geolocation automatically choose location for a weather forecast is a better option, but this solution has a few flaws:
1. For this solution to function, users first have to be asked, and then they have to confirm, for browser to share their location.
Even without discussing users' privacy concerns, users are fed up with websites asking for permissions to allow web plugins to function (flash, silverlight...), permissions for browsers to send notifications, (infamous) cookies permissions, video ads permissions etc.
Asking permission from user to allow browser to share their location is just one more nuisance that deteriorates site’s UX. In addition, users tend to ignore browser notifications in a same way they ignore ads.
2. Starting with Chrome 50 (released April 20 2016), Chrome browser no longer supports obtaining the user's location using the HTML5 Geolocation API from pages delivered by non-secure connections. This means that the page that's making the Geolocation API call must be served from a secure context such as HTTPS.
In short - Chrome (with 58.4 percent of the browser market) allowes users' geolocation only on HTTPS (less than 50%) websites. (and soon other browsers will follow same practice)
3. If geolocation is not possible, the fallback plan would be using visitors IP address to detect their location. This "plan B" is not so accurate.
4. Users can't choose location other then their current location.

Solution where users choose desired location from a drop-down is simple, reliable and understandable to users.

= Can multiple weather widgets be placed on the same page? =
Yes.
Placing multiple widgets (either in a sidebar or in content) on the same page is not a problem.
Each widget and has individual options and "lives independently".

(for issues and other questions please check plugin's [support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/weather-atlas))

= Will (multiple) weather widgets slow down a website? =
No.
Widgets show cached weather data (stored in your database), and periodically update data from our service.
